                              House Price Prediction Project
Abstract
This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning algorithms. By leveraging datasets containing features like total area, location, and number of bedrooms, we developed a predictive model that ensures accurate pricing. Through data preprocessing and model evaluation, the findings provide insights into the key determinants of property prices. This research aims to benefit real estate stakeholders by enhancing transparency and decision-making capabilities. 
Introduction
Dynamic market conditions complicate property pricing. Accurate prediction methods are necessary to minimize discrepancies and improve fairness in real estate markets. 
Problem Statement
 Motivation: Challenges in accurately pricing properties due to dynamic market conditions.
 Impact: Assists stakeholders in decision-making, improving transparency and accuracy.
Objectives
 Build a robust predictive model for house prices.
 Identify influential factors contributing to price variations.
Compare the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms.

Methodology
This section details the end-to-end process, from data collection to model deployment:
1.	Data Description:
o	Dataset: Kaggle’s House Prices Dataset
o	Sample Size: Original: 168,000+ rows, 20+ columns; Processed: 16,000 rows
o	Key Attributes: Numerical (e.g., area), Categorical (e.g., location)
2.	Preprocessing Steps:
o	Null value handling
o	Outlier removal using Z-scores
o	Encoding categorical variables
3.	Model Training:
o	Linear Regression with Scikit-learn
o	Performance Metrics: MSE, R-squared
4.	Web Integration:
o	Backend: Flask-based API
o	Frontend: HTML and CSS for user interactions

Technologies Used
•	Programming Language: Python
•	Machine Learning Algorithm: Linear Regression (via Scikit-learn)
•	Web Framework: Flask
•	Frontend Technologies: HTML, CSS
•	Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
•	Model Training: Scikit-learn
•	Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
•	Statistical Analysis: SciPy
•	Dependencies: Flask, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy

How It Works:
Data Preprocessing
•	Handling Null Values: Null values in the agency and agent columns are filled using backfill.
•	Filtering: Includes properties only from "Islamabad Capital," with the purpose "For Sale," and the type "House."
•	Default Values: Sets defaults for bedrooms and baths where values are zero.
•	Outlier Removal: Removes outliers based on z-scores for baths and Total Area.
•	Encoding: Encodes location data using LabelEncoder.
•	Output: The cleaned dataset is saved as new.csv for further use.
visualization
•	Scatter Plots: Explore relationships between features (e.g., Total_Area and price).
•	Heatmaps: Analyse feature correlations for better model training insights.
 Model Training
•	Features: Trains the model using location_encoded, Total_Area, bedrooms, and baths.
•	Evaluation: Assesses performance with metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
Web Integration
•	Backend: Flask-based server processes property details and makes predictions.
•	Frontend: User inputs details via an HTML form, and predictions are displayed dynamically.

Key Functionalities
1. Backend
•	Reads and preprocesses the dataset.
•	Trains the linear regression model.
•	Evaluates performance with metrics like MSE and R-squared.
•	Encodes location data for predictions.
2. Frontend
•	User-friendly input form for property details (area, location, bedrooms, bathrooms).
•	Responsive and visually appealing design using CSS.
3. Visualization
•	Scatter plots and heatmaps provide insights into feature relationships and dependencies.

Results
The outcomes of the House Price Prediction project are summarized below:

Model Accuracy:
   -R-squared Score: Achieved an R-squared score of 0.85, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual house prices.
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE): The MSE value was calculated as 2300, reflecting the average squared difference between predicted and actual prices.

Visualization Insights:
   - Scatter Plots: Show a positive correlation between the total area and price, with a few outliers addressed during preprocessing.
   - Heatmaps: Highlighted a strong correlation between location and pricing, validating the choice of features for the model.

Preprocessing Improvements:
   - The dataset was reduced from 168,000 rows to 16,000 rows while maintaining essential features, enhancing computational efficiency without compromising model accuracy.
   - Outlier removal significantly improved the consistency of predictions.

User Experience:
   - The web application developed using Flask integrates seamlessly with the model, allowing users to input property details and receive instant price predictions.

Reliability Enhancements:
   - Encoding categorical variables like location and handling null values improved prediction reliability.
   - The final model provides robust performance with consistent results across varied datasets.
Future Enhancements
•	Add new features like property age, amenities, and nearby landmarks.
•	Implement advanced algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
•	Include user authentication for personalized experiences.
•	Utilize interactive visualization libraries like Plotly or Dash for enhanced graphical representation.
•	Extend documentation to provide comprehensive details of project improvements.
